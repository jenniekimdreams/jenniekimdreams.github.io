        <p><strong>Pancakes</strong> are often considered a weekend-only treat, but there’s no denying that the other five days would be substantially better if they, too, started with a warm short stack. To make this an actually feasible option on hectic mornings, you have a few options. <em>You can make and freeze <strong>pancakes</strong></em> in advance (or <em>even freeze the batter</em>), or you could master this one-bowl recipe that requires just six pantry ingredients and is ready in 30 minutes or less.</p>

        <h2>4 Tips for Better Basic Pancakes</h2>
    <ul>
   <p> <li><strong>Use your pantry!</strong> I often have buttermilk on hand (my husband is a born-and-bred Southerner), and I don’t mind whisking the occasional egg white for lofty pancakes, but on a Tuesday morning at 7:10 a.m. with an internal countdown to the minute the school bell rings, I am not reaching for either. These pancakes rely purely on kitchen staples: all-purpose flour, a little sugar, milk, eggs, and baking powder. The baking powder is responsible for these pancakes’ rise, so it helps that you aerate the batter well with a whisk and thatyou let the batter rest before cooking.</li> </p>
   <p> <li><strong>A single bowl is perfect for mixing. </strong> There’s no need to dirty multiple bowls. Simply whisk together the dry ingredients first, then add the milk, oil, and eggs and whisk to combine.</li> </p>
   <p> <li><strong>Always rest the batter.</strong> After mixing, be sure to rest the batter for about 10 minutes. This gives the flour a chance to properly hydrate and the baking powder time to activate. Refill your coffee and pull out your favorite pancake pan, and by the time you return the batter will be ready to go.</li> </p>
    <p><li><strong>Use cast iron for cooking.</strong> Cast iron is my skillet of choice for pancakes, because it heats well and browns the pancakes without an excess of butter. A nonstick pan or a griddle can be used, too.</li> </p>

    <h2 id="spaghetti-and-meatballs">Spaghetti and Meatballs</h2>
    
    <p>Spaghetti and meatballs in the Instant Pot is an absolute dinner game-changer. Now that I’ve figured out how to make spaghetti with big ol’ juicy meatballs in a garlicky marinara sauce in the Instant Pot, I’m never making them any other way again.</p>

<p>Last year, I discovered <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/instant-pot-spaghetti-264230">just how good spaghetti and meat sauce could be in the Instant Pot.</a> The high pressure combined with the pasta’s starches makes for the most luxurious sauce with minimal effort. Adding meatballs seemed like a no-brainer. It took some serious trial and error, but I can now confidently present to you this recipe for the very best Instant Pot spaghetti and meatballs.</p>

        <div class="s-and-m-pic">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Spaghetti_and_meatballs_1.jpg/1024px-Spaghetti_and_meatballs_1.jpg" width="450">

        <h2>Perfect Spaghetti and Meatballs In an   Instant (Pot)
</h2>

        <p>I initially tried a mash-up of our Instant Pot Spaghetti and our <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/instant-pot-meatballs-22931805">Instant Pot Meatballs</a>, but this resulted in either overcooked meatballs or spaghetti, or the dreaded “burn” error. To solve for this, I adjusted the size of the meatballs and skipped the browning step, which helped with cooking times and ultimately made for juicer, better-tasting meatballs. Building a sauce with garlic, butter, and canned tomatoes (rather than starting with a canned sauce) gave me more control and prevented the burn warning. Here’s a quick rundown of the order of events:</p>
        
            <p>1. <strong>Make the meatballs.</strong> You’ll start by making golf ball-sized meatballs (about 2 tablespoons each).</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Build the sauce.</strong> You’ll build the sauce in the Instant Pot using the Sauté function, then add the meatballs. Avoid cramming them together, but don’t worry if they overlap or sit on top of one another. Add the dry spaghetti and cover with water.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>Cook on high pressure.</strong> Cook on HIGH pressure for 8 minutes, then do a quick release. Don’t fret if the pasta looks a little watery when you first peek into the pot — as you stir everything together, the spaghetti will absorb more water and sauce.</p>
            <p>4. <strong>Serve with lots of cheese.</strong> Serve each bowl with lots of Parmesan cheese and prepare to fall in love with this easy, delicious Instant Pot recipe.</p>

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
        
       <p><strong>Step 1:</strong><strong> Make the meatballs:</strong> Use the small holes of a box grater to finely grate 2 ounces Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup). Grate more Parmesan cheese for serving.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 2:</strong><strong> Beat 1 large egg in a medium bowl with a fork until broken up.</strong> Add the 2 ounces grated Parmesan, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1/3 cup dry breadcrumbs, 1/3 cup whole milk, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Gently mix with your hands until evenly combined, but do not overmix. Roll the mixture into 2-tablespoon balls and place on a plate or baking sheet.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 3:</strong><strong> Make the sauce:</strong> Thinly slice 4 garlic cloves and finely chop 1 large shallot. Heat a 6-quart or larger Instant Pot or electric pressure cooker with the Sauté function for 2 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, followed by the garlic and shallot. Cook, stirring regularly, until the shallot just begins to soften, about 4 minutes.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 4:</strong><strong> Add 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes and stir to combine.</strong> Add 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar. Turn off the pressure cooker and stir until the butter is melted.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 5:</strong><strong> Gently add the meatballs to the sauce.</strong> Don’t worry if they are snug in the pot or aren’t completely covered — stack a few on top of each other as needed but don’t smoosh them.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 6:</strong><strong> Make the spaghetti: </strong> Break 12 ounces dried spaghetti in half with your hands and spread them in one or two layers over the meatballs. Do not stir from this point on. Pour in 2 cups low-sodium beef broth.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 7:</strong><strong> Lock the lid on and make sure the valve is set to seal.</strong> Set to cook on HIGH pressure for 8 minutes. It will take 10 to 12 minutes to come up to pressure.</p>
       <p><strong>Step 8:</strong><strong> When the cook time is up, quick release the pressure.</strong> Turn off the pressure cooker and uncover. The mixture might look watery, but stir the spaghetti into the sauce and it will soak it up. Serve immediately with a flurry of grated Parmesan cheese.</p>

        <p>Frozen pizzas have their time and place, like when we need a backup meal when we don’t have time to shop or an easy heat-and-serve dinner for babysitters. There’s nothing wrong with a good store-bought frozen pizza in these situations, but making your own homemade frozen pizzas from scratch will probably save you some pennies — plus, you get exactly the toppings you want!</p>

        <p>It’s also easy to do. With just two little tricks you can fill your freezer with all the made-ahead frozen pizzas you could ever want.</p>

        <h2>Key Steps to Better Frozen Pizza at Home</h2>
        <h3>Par-bake the crust.</h3>
        
    <p>The first trick is to par-bake the crust, which sounds more complicated than it really is. Par-baking really just means you partially bake the crust before topping and freezing it. This ensures an extra-crisp crust and zero sogginess upon final baking. (P.S.: These par-baked crust can be frozen without toppings too, which is an ingenious way to prep for a personal pizza party.)</p>
    
    <h3>Freeze the pizzas uncovered in a single layer.</h3>
    
    <p>When the par-baked crusts are cooled, top them with your favorite toppings and then freeze them unwrapped on a baking sheet until solid, about three hours. This prevents the wrapping from clinging to the cheese and sauce and makes them easier to unwrap later.</p>
    
    <h3>Double-wrap the pizzas before freezing.</h3>
    
    <p>The second trick is to wrap the par-baked and topped pizzas first in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. This double layer protects pizzas and their toppings from drying out in the freezer, which leads to freezer burn and a less-than-stellar pizza. Wrapped this way, pizzas can be kept frozen for up to three months.</p>
    
    <h3>Bake the pizzas from frozen.</h3>
    
    <p>When you’re ready to bake your frozen pizza, crank the oven to 500°F and ready a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven for baking. Take the pizzas directly from the freezer, unwrap, and bake from frozen.</p>
    
    <ul>
            <li>Serves 2 to 4</li>
            <li>Makes 1 large pizza or 2 individual pizzas</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong><strong> Preheat the oven to 450°F.</strong> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, place a baking stone or baking sheet on the rack, and heat to 450°F.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong><strong> Roll out the pizza rounds.</strong> Divide the pizza dough in half to make 2 individual pizzas, if desired. Place the ball of dough in the middle of a piece of parchment paper. Roll it out to your preferred thinness. If the dough starts to shrink back and crinkle the paper, let it rest for a few minutes and then try rolling it out again. If making 2 individual pizzas, repeat with the second round of dough.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong><strong> Par-bake the pizza rounds. </strong>Slide the pizza rounds on the parchment sheets onto the hot baking stone or baking sheet. Bake until the rounds are puffy and dry on the top, but still very pale, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong><strong> Let the pizza rounds cool completely.</strong> Remove the parchment from beneath the pizza rounds and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong><strong> Top the pizzas. </strong>When cool, top the rounds as you would if you were going to bake them right away: Spread some sauce on the pizzas, add toppings, and sprinkle cheese over the top. <em>Note: Pizza rounds can also be frozen un-topped.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong><strong> Freeze the pizzas. </strong>Place the pizzas on a baking sheet and freeze, uncovered, until solid, about 3 hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong><strong> Wrap the pizzas in plastic wrap and aluminum foil.</strong> Once frozen, remove the pizzas from the freezer and wrap them first in plastic wrap. Write the pizza toppings on a piece of masking tape and stick the label to the plastic wrap. Then, wrap the pizzas in a layer of aluminum foil. The double layer protects the pizzas from drying out in the freezer.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong><strong> Freeze for pizzas for up to 3 months. </strong>The pizzas can be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong><strong> Bake the frozen pizzas. </strong>When ready to bake the pizzas, heat the oven to 550°F (or the temperature at which you normally cook your pizzas). If you have a baking stone, place it in the oven as it heats; frozen pizzas can also be baked on the foil used to wrap them. Unwrap the pizzas, discard the plastic wrap, and slide into the oven. Bake until the crust is dark brown and the cheese in the center of the pizza is bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool a few minutes, slice, and serve.</p>

    <h2 id="beef-birria-tacos">Beef Birria Tacos</h2>
    
    <p>On a chilly day, there’s nothing like a big bowl of birria with warm consommé. But birria tacos — and specifically quesatacos? Well, there’s a reason I can’t stop making them. Quesatacos (also known as quesabirria) are a cross between a taco and a quesadilla, filled with melty cheese and the delicious shredded beef. In this step-by-step guide, I’ll walk you through making the very best homemade birria, and, most importantly, how to turn it into quesatacos.</p>

    <h2>What Is Birria?</h2>
    
    <p>Birria is a savory Mexican stew that originated in Jalisco. Although it’s traditionally prepared with goat or sheep, the beef version has gained popularity in the past three years since goat isn’t as readily available. (I’ve tried birria prepared with goat and it’s delicious, but I have to say, I prefer the beef version.) The surrounding states of Zacatecas and Colima have their own unique versions of birria as well. </p>
    
    <p>Restaurants, street carts, and food trucks throughout Mexico and the United States are known as birrierias, and they each claim to have their own secret ingredient that makes their recipe the best. My secret is simply to use the freshest ingredients available: ripe tomatoes, soft chile pods (not ones that are old and cracking), and fresh herbs and spices. It may take you a few attempts to find the exact flavor that suits your palate, but that’s the fun part of cooking.</p>
    
    <p>A few years back on a trip to Texas, I made it my mission to try as many kinds of birria tacos as I could, and I had to pace myself because there were so many restaurants to choose from! Many places are getting creative and adding the braised beef to burritos, flautas, empanadas, ramen, and pizza, too. I’ve tried them all - sooo good.</p>

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong><strong> Cut and season the beef. </strong>Cut 3/12 pounds chuck roast into 12 pieces. Season with 2 teaspoons of the kosher salt and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong><strong> Prepare the chiles, onion, and ginger. </strong>Using kitchen shears, cut the stems from 4 guajillo and 2 ancho chiles. Remove the seeds. Peel and halve 1 large white onion. Peel 1-inch fresh ginger and cut in half. Place the chiles, half the onion (reserve the other half of the onion), and ginger in a 6-quart or larger pressure cooker.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong><strong> Cook the aromatics.</strong> Add 5 peeled garlic cloves, 2 plum tomatoes, and 5 cups water. Using the highest Sauté setting, bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong><strong> Blend the sauce. </strong>Turn off the cooker. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the chiles, onion, garlic, tomatoes, and ginger to a blender. Add 2 cups of the cooking liquid, the remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves. Blend on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong><strong> Strain the sauce. </strong>Fit a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Strain the sauce and push it through the strainer with the bottom of a ladle until only a thick paste remains in the strainer. Discard the contents of the strainer.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong><strong> Sear the beef. </strong>Empty, wash, and dry the insert of the pressure cooker. Add 1/4 cup avocado oil to the pressure cooker and heat on the highest Sauté setting for 5 minutes. Add half the beef and sear until browned on a few sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat searing the remaining beef.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong><strong> Pressure cook the beef. </strong>Return all the beef and any accumulated juices to the pressure cooker. Add the strained sauce, 5 cups beef broth, and 4 fresh thyme sprigs. Lock on the lid and make sure the valve is set to seal. Set to cook on HIGH pressure for 40 minutes. It will take 15 to 20 minutes to come up to pressure. Meanwhile, prepare the toppings.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong><strong> Prepare the toppings. </strong>Dice the reserved 1/2 onion. (If you’d like a less spicy onion, rinse under cold water.) Finely chop 1 cup fresh cilantro. Cut 2 limes into wedges. Shred 1 pound cheese if desired. Refrigerate in separate containers.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong><strong> Release the pressure naturally. </strong>When the cook time is up, let the pressure naturally release for 15 minutes. Quick release any remaining pressure.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong><strong> Shred the beef. </strong>Heat the oven to 250ºF. Using a slotted spoon, transfer all of the beef to a large bowl. Shred the beef with 2 forks, discarding any chunks of fat. Discard the thyme sprigs. Taste and season the beef and cooking liquid (consommé) with kosher salt as needed -- they should be very well seasoned.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 11:</strong><strong> Dip the tortillas. </strong>Heat a griddle or large nonstick frying pan over medium heat (or about 350ºF on a griddle). Working with as many tortillas will fit in a single layer in the pan or griddle, dip the tortillas one at a time in the consommé. Place in the pan in a single layer.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 12:</strong><strong> Fill the tacos. </strong>If making quesatacos (cheese birria tacos), sprinkle about 1/4 cup of the cheese onto each tortilla first. Top one half of each tortilla with about 1/4 cup shredded beef. Drizzle the beef with a little more consommé.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 13:</strong><strong> Cook until crispy. </strong>When the cheese is melted, fold each tortilla in half. Cook, flipping halfway through, until browned in spots and crispy, 5 to 6 minutes total.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 14:</strong><strong> Keep the tacos warm. </strong>Transfer the tacos to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat assembling and cooking the remaining tacos. Serve the tacos garnished with the diced onion, cilantro, and lime wedges, with small bowls of consommé for dipping.</p>
        
        <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Make ahead: </strong>The chile sauce can be made ahead of time and kept frozen for a few months.</p>
        <p><strong>Storage: </strong>Once cooled, the birria and consommé can be stored in the refrigerator in separate airtight containers for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Defrost in the refrigerator the day before and reheat over medium heat for until warmed through, adding some of the consommé to the birria if it seems dry.</p>
        <p><strong>Stovetop pressure cooking: </strong>If using a stovetop pressure cooker, cook the chiles and sear the beef in the cooker over medium-high heat. When ready to pressure cook, lock the lid on. Place over high heat. In about 10 minutes, the pressure cooker will come up to high pressure. Reduce the heat to below medium and pressure cooker for 40 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.</p>
        <p><strong>Slow cooker: </strong>Cook the chile sauce and sear the beef in a Dutch oven, then transfer to a slow cooker. Use some of the beef broth to deglaze the browned bits from the pan, and add that to the slow cooker also. Proceed with the recipe and cook on the LOW setting for 6 to 8 hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Dutch oven cooking: </strong> Sear and braise in a covered Dutch oven for 4 hours over medium heat.</p>
